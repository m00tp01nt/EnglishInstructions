    <h1>How To Replace Your Laptop's Thermal Paste</h1>
    <div class="description italics main-column">
        <p>These instructions are intended for laptop-owning tech-savvy do-it-yourself people whose laptops are overheating or slow/experiencing performance issues.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="description main-column">
        <h2>What is thermal paste?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/explorer/glossary/what-is-thermal-paste">Thermal paste</a> is a thermally conductive compound inside computers that helps distribute heat away from heat generating components. Over time it dries out, becoming less effective, and leading to overheating.</p>
        <p>When thermal paste dries out, it should be replaced to keep your laptop running smoothly.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>
        Step 1 - Is the problem your thermal paste?
    </h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Before doing anything, be sure the problem is dry thermal paste. Follow these instructions to check.
        </p>

        <h3>Listen to your laptop's fans</h3>
            <p>If they are always on, even when your laptop isn't doing anything, dry thermal paste could be the problem.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that if the environment the laptop is in is hot, the laptop will run hotter than normal. If this is the case, moving to a cooler or air-conditioned room may solve performance issues.</p>
        <h3>Use MSI Afterburner to check the temperature of your laptop's components</h3>
        <p>Go to the MSI Afterburner <a href="https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards">website</a>. Download the version labled [Final]. Then, follow the steps below to install it to your system.</p>

    <!-- Show Temperatures -->
    <p>Now that MSI Afterburner is installed, we can use it to see the temperature of our CPU and GPU.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Our CPU is like the brains of our computer. Your programs and apps run on the CPU.</li>
        <li>Our GPU is what makes games and professional software run faster. It helps offload tasks in your programs and apps from the CPU.</li>
    </ul>

                <img src="pictures/GPU1Temperature.png">
                <p>A new window will open called the Hardware Monitor. This window gives you information about different components inside your laptop. We are interested in CPU and GPU temperature. On the right side of the Hardware Monitor, look for "GPU1 Temperature" (shown above) and "CPU temperature". They probably won't be nex to each other, and you many have to scroll through the list to find them. The text will be hard to read.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-buttons">

            <button class="carousel-button next">&#8594;</button>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Interpret temperatures -->
    <p>After you've found your GPU and CPU temperatures in the Hardware Monitor, close all the programs and apps that are non-essential. This ensure the computer is idleing, or doing the bare minimum amount of work.</p>
    <p>Monitor the graph for about 30 seconds to get a good idea of how hot your components are while the computer isn't working hard.</p>
    <p>Check your laptop manufacturor's website for exact temperatures, but a good rule of thumb is all components should be below 50 degrees celcius while the computer is idle.</p>
    <p>If the temperatures shown are below 50 degrees celcius, temperature is probably not the thing slowing down your laptop.</p>
    <p>If the temperatures are above 50 degrees celcius, replacing the thermal paste could help solve your performance problem.</p>

    <h2>Step 2 - Tear down the laptop</h2>

    <p>Before we start, <b>make sure you have new thermal paste on hand!</b> It would be the pits if you have your laptop all torn up only to realize you forgot to get good thermal paste.</p>
    <p>Do some research to figure out what you need, but in general, you don't need anything too fancy. I got the cheapest I could find at my local Best Buy and it's worked fine.</p>
    <p>These steps are general outlines for tearing down laptops, specifically those designed for gaming. Your laptop may have extra steps, or not need a particular step.</p>
    <p>If you don't feel comfortable continuing while the laptop is still open, take a break. If after the break you still don't feel comfortable continuing, put the laptop back together, and contact professional tech support about your issue. I'll let you know when we've hit the point of no return on the disassembly side.</p>
    <p>You're going to need some tools before you start.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Microfiber Cloth</li>
        <li>Isopropyl Alcohol</li>
        <li>Thermal Paste</li>
        <li>Small non-magnetic screwdriver with multiple bits</li>
        <li>A couple plastic pry tools</li>
        <li>Gloves for handling the thermal paste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also reccomend figuring out your system for storing screws before you start. I'll be using a magnetic screw holder, but small cups or office supply organizers work just as well.</p>

                <p>Here's my setup. I have a good amount of space to work on and excellent lighting. The working surface is clean and uniform, making dropped screws easy to find. I've also got an iPad on the left so I can look up problems as I run into them. All my tools are laid out where I can see and access them easily.</p>

                <p>Turn your laptop upside down and locate the battery. The first thing you should do when disassembling any electronic device is removing the power from the system. The battery may be screwed into place, or latched like mine is above.</p>

                <p>After all the screws are removed, slide your plastic pry tools into the seams of the laptop, but <b>steer clear of ports.</b> Ports have delicate cables that connect them to internal components, and if the cables break, the ports break. The goal here is to seperate the back plastic bottom from the chasis the laptop internals are screwed to. Expect to hear some clips snapping.</p>

                <p>Gently lift the bottom of the laptop near its front, opposite of its hinge. Don't force it off. If it doesn't come up easily, you may have missed a screw or two.</p>

    <h2>Step 3 - Apply new thermal paste</h2>
    <p>For this section, it's important to get good airflow. I'm going to open the window I'm working by. If you're in a smaller room, just using a fan may not be enough, and you could have to move to a different room. Saftey is key.</p>
    <p>I'm also going to put on some gloves. <a href="https://koolingmonster.com/insights/is-thermal-paste-toxic">Modern thermal paste isn't dangerous</a>, but it may be difficult to clean off your hands.</p>

    <p>The laptop is reassembled. Now, lets see if our performance problem was solved!</p>

    <h2>Step 5 - Testing</h2>
    <p>Now that the laptop is reassembled with fresh thermal paste, turn it on and start MSI Afterburner.</p>
    <p>Open the Hardware Monitor, and check if the temperature of your components has gone down.</p>
    <p>If they have, but you're still having performance issues, you can take dry thermal paste off your list of possibilities.</p>
