    <h1>How To Replace Your Laptop's Thermal Paste</h1>
    <p>These instructions are intended for laptop-owning tech-savvy do-it-yourself people whose laptops are overheating or slow/experiencing performance issues.</p>
    <p>If you don't feel comfortable taking apart your laptop, call tech support.</p>

    <h3>What is thermal paste?</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/explorer/glossary/what-is-thermal-paste">Thermal paste</a> is a thermally conductive compound inside computers that helps distribute heat away from heat generating components. Over time it dries out, becoming less effective, and leading to overheating.</p>
    <p>When thermal paste dries out, it should be replaced to keep your laptop running smoothly.</p>

    <h3>Supplies and Tools</h3>
    <p>You're going to need some tools before you start.</p>    
    <input type="checkbox">Thermal Paste<br>
    <input type="checkbox">Microfiber Cloth<br>
    <input type="checkbox">Isopropyl Alcohol<br>
    <input type="checkbox">Small non-magnetic screwdriver with multiple bits<br>
    <input type="checkbox">Some couple plastic pry tools<br>
    <input type="checkbox">Gloves for handling the thermal paste<br>

    <h2>Step 1 - Is the problem your thermal paste?</h2>
    <p>Before doing anything, be sure the problem is dry thermal paste. Follow these instructions to check.</p>

    <h3>Listen to your laptop's fans</h3>
    <p>If your laptop's fans are always on, even when your laptop isn't doing anything, dry thermal paste could be the problem.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that if the environment the laptop is in is hot, the laptop will run hotter than normal. If this is the case, moving to a cooler or air-conditioned room may solve performance issues.</p>
    
    <h3>Use MSI Afterburner to check the temperature of your laptop's components</h3>
    <p>Go to the MSI Afterburner <a href="https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards">website</a>. Download the version labeled [Final]. Then, follow the steps below to install it to your system.</p>

    <p>Now that MSI Afterburner is installed, we can use it to see the temperature of our CPU and GPU.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Our CPU is like the brains of our computer. Your programs and apps run on the CPU.</li>
        <li>Our GPU is what makes games and professional software run faster. It helps offload tasks in your programs and apps from the CPU.</li>
    </ul>

                <img class="expandable" src="pictures/OpenDiagnostics.webp">
                <p>On the left side, click the icon showing a monitor with a graph. (20)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <img class="expandable" src="pictures/GPU1Temperature.webp">
                <p>A new window will open called the Hardware Monitor. This window gives live information about different components inside your laptop. We are interested in CPU and GPU temperature. On the right side of the Hardware Monitor, look for "GPU1 Temperature" (shown above) and "CPU temperature". They probably won't be next to each other, and you many have to scroll through the list to find them. The text will be hard to read.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="carousel-buttons">
            <button class="carousel-button prev">&#8592;</button>

            <button class="carousel-button next">&#8594;</button>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>After you've found your GPU and CPU temperatures in the Hardware Monitor, close all the programs and apps that are non-essential. This ensure the computer is idling, or doing the bare minimum amount of work.</p>
    <p>Monitor the graph for about 30 seconds to get a good idea of how hot your components are while the computer isn't working hard.</p>
    <p>Check your laptop manufacturer's website for exact temperatures, but a good rule of thumb is all components should be below 50 degrees Celsius while the computer is idle.</p>
    <p>If the temperatures shown are below 50 degrees Celsius, temperature is probably not the thing slowing down your laptop.</p>
    <p>If the temperatures are above 50 degrees Celsius, replacing the thermal paste could help solve your performance problem.</p>

    <h2>Step 2 - Tear down the laptop</h2>

    <p>Before we continue, <b>make sure you have new thermal paste on hand!</b> It would be the pits if you have your laptop all torn up only to realize you forgot to get good thermal paste.</p>
    <p>Do some research to figure out what you need, but in general, you don't need anything too fancy. I got the cheapest I could find at my local Best Buy and it's worked fine.</p>
    <p>These steps are general outlines for tearing down laptops, specifically those designed for gaming. Your laptop may have extra steps, or not need a particular step.</p>
    <p>If you don't feel comfortable continuing while the laptop is still open, take a break. If after the break you still don't feel comfortable continuing, put the laptop back together, and contact professional tech support about your issue. I'll let you know when we've hit the point of no return on the disassembly side.</p>
    <p>I also recommend figuring out your system for storing screws before you start. I'll be using a magnetic screw holder, but small cups or office supply organizers work just as well.</p>

                <p>Here's my setup. I have a good amount of space to work on and excellent lighting. The working surface is clean and uniform, making dropped screws easy to find.

                <p>Turn your laptop upside down and locate the battery. The first thing you should do when disassembling any electronic device is removing the power from the system. The battery may be screwed into place, or latched like mine is above.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <img class="expandable" src="pictures/IMG_0329.webp">
                <p>After all the screws are removed, slide your plastic pry tools into the seams of the laptop, but <b>steer clear of ports.</b> Ports have delicate cables that connect them to internal components, and if the cables break, the ports break. The goal here is to separate the back plastic bottom from the chassis the laptop internals are screwed to. Expect to hear some clips snapping.</p>

                <img class="expandable" src="pictures/IMG_0333.webp">
                <p>Gently lift the bottom of the laptop near its front, opposite of its hinge. Don't force it off. If it doesn't come up easily, you may have missed a screw or two.</p>

    <p>Congratulations! You're inside your laptop. Let's take a second to get our bearings before we go any deeper.</p>
    <p>Everything is screwed and plugged into the motherboard. Components use the motherboard to talk to each other.</p>

    <p>After you've located your cooling system (fans, radiators, and one or two cooling blocks), go ahead and continue tearing the laptop down. This is the point of no return. After you've lifted the cooling system out of the laptop, you should avoid reassembling the laptop until fresh thermal paste has been applied.</p>

    <h2>Step 3 - Apply new thermal paste</h2>
    <p>For this section, it's important to get good airflow. I'm going to open the window I'm working by. If you're in a smaller room, just using a fan may not be enough, and you could have to move to a different room. Safety is key.</p>
    <p>I'm also going to put on some gloves. <a href="https://koolingmonster.com/insights/is-thermal-paste-toxic">Modern thermal paste isn't dangerous</a>, but it may be difficult to clean off your hands.</p>

    <h2>Step 4 - Reassembly</h2>
    <p>This is basically step 1, but in reverse.</p>

    <p>The laptop is reassembled. Now, let's see if our performance problem was solved!</p>

    <h2>Step 5 - Testing</h2>
    <p>Now that the laptop is reassembled with fresh thermal paste, turn it on and start MSI Afterburner.</p>
    <p>Open the Hardware Monitor, and check if the temperature of your components has gone down.</p>
    <p>If they have, but you're still having performance issues, you can take dry thermal paste off your list of possibilities.</p>
